# V0.1 #


This version of the project is a simple c++ application.
It calculates final grade of a student using average or median,
with an option to generate random grades. It uses input from console.

## Usage ##

There is two different program applications, one using arrays _v01array_ and one using vectors _v01vector_.
_Both_ files need header file _Mylib.h_ in order to work.
The only difference in usage is that array version asks for number of students, while vector version waits for specific input to stop.
